#Choose Your Own Adventure Game

This program is a text-based, choose your own adventure-type game created in Jython, a coding language based heavily on Python and Java and their basic methods, structure, and syntax.
It follows a spaceman (the user) on an adventure through a spaceship while they pick up items, look for clues, and open locked doors with keys. 
This program can be run by installing JES, and downloading the files into the JES software.
To complete the game, enter various rooms and pick up items. Read each instruction carefully, as they may contain clues on where to go next.
